Global Coordinate System: spheroid model + datum + geoid (gravity field model: global mean sea level for elevation reference)

or Solving problems when flattening the Earth (an ellipsoid/spheroid) from 3D to 2D

Spheroids 
Since the Earth is not a perfect sphere, we must account for the different length of its axes:
Speroids:	major	minor axes (m)	reference
Clarke_1866  6378206.4  6356583.8 	Mead's ranch in Kansas
GRS_1980     6378137    6356752.31414   Earth center
WGS_1984     6378137    6356752.31424518 ::  global ellipsoid model, geocentric, standard for GPS

[WGS = World Geodetic System;
GRS = Geodetic Reference System]

Datum: surface benchmarks from surveys => network of standardized horizontal positions.
Any given spheroid has a smooth surface: not realistic (the earth's gravity field is not fixed).
"A datum is built on top of the selected spheroid, and can incorporate local variations in elevation."[1]

NAD83	North America, ellipsoid: GRS80
ETRS89	Europe
OSGB36	Great Britain
JGD2011 Japanese Datum

Coordinate reference system (CRS) codes:

"The IOGP’s EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a collection of definitions of coordinate reference systems and coordinate transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in application."[1]

These codes show up when you examine the crs of a shapefile. 
For example calling the crs method of the geopandas dataframes for NYC and Boston,we can see they differ:
```
nyc_shp.crs	{'init': 'epsg:2263'}
boston_shp.crs	{'init': 'epsg:4326'}

EPSG:4326 belongs to the WGS84 GCS (lat, lon in DD)

Geodesics + Global Positioning System (GPS) => relativity (SR and GR)

The GPS ia an array of satellites orbiting the Earth which emit radio signals along with the signal start time from their atomic clock. This data and the speed of light is used by a ground receiver to obtain its lat, lon and time with a (common) accuracy of ~ 5 meters and local time to 40 billionths of a second[1].

The correction that any GPS receiver applies to the data accounts for two oposite, relativistic effects that do not cancel each other out.

This is because funny thinks happen when clocks are fast moving (~14,000 km/hr) at an altitude where gravity is about 4 times weaker than on Earth (~20 km).

Special Relativity effect (time dilation viz c): T1
	A fast moving clock ticks more slowly (~6 microsec/day)
General Relativity effect (space and time curvature due to gravity): T2
	The orbiting clock ticks slightly faster, by about (~45 microsec/day).

Correction: T2 - T1 = ~38 microsec/day (or about 10km/day)
