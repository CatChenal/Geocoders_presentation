# Comparison of Four Geocoders: Nominatim, GoogleV3, ArcGis and AzureMaps

I've implemented the "sliderReport.html" by modifying a ["JS-less CSS slider"](https://github.com/drygiel/csslider) designed by GH user drygiel"

Thank you, drygiel!

## New Report:

* `sliderReport.html` is the html report above mentioned; uses `custom_slid.css`. 

It is functional only on <a href="https://catchenal.github.io/assets/sliderReport.html" target="_blank">my GH page</a>.  

 I've tried launching it via [htmlpreview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/) but the images or frames are not rendered whether the linking to images and frames is done using relative or absolute address.
